# CodingQuiz

## Here, I built an application that will test your knowledge.

## Some functionality is still being worked out.

- The user will hit start, and a timer will start.
- the user will pick answer
- the score will go up or down depending on if the user chose the correct answer.
- at the end, the remaing time is added to the score, meaning, the faster you answer, the higher your score.
